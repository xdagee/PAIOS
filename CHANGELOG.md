   - You can now pin chats to the top of the list.
   - You can now rename chats yourself or get a title from Gemini Nano.
 - Updated Settings
   - Adding per-chat settings, some options were moved from settings to per-chat ones.
 - Refactoring and optimisation
   - Rewrited dart-side of the generator,
   - Removed obsolete files,
   - Optimized file structure.
 - Bug fixes
   - (some of them were fixed just by changing the structure)
 - Master Prompt changes
 - Ability to go instruction-less
   - When toggled, model will only receive minimal instructions with chat history.
   - This WILL produce weird and incorrect responses, with lots of hallucinations.
   - Use at your own risk!
 - Auto-retry now works better and in more situations 
#### Fixes
 - Fixed some unwanted prompting behavior in the master prompt
#### Known Issues
 - Rapidly switching between chats (especially when the AI is still generating) may cause messages to not save.
 - Exiting the chat into the chat menu when generating may cause some temporary lagging.
 - Closing the app before response generates may cause loss of the last generated text.
 - Closing the chat before the name of the chat changes will likely make chat history empty.
 - Typing curses or slurs may soft-lock the app if the auto-retry is enabled
   - This happens because model hits an internal censorship and reports an error;
   - When encountering error while generating, with auto-retry, app sends the same input back, getting the same error;
   - This feedback loop will not end untill the app is restarted, and it also consumes huge amount of battery life.
