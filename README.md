### Features
 - **100% Offline & Private**: Runs entirely on-device using Google's AI Core. No data leaves your phone.
 - **Full Model Control**: Adjust Temperature and Max Response Tokens.
 - **Multiple Chats**: Create, rename, and pin multiple conversations with their own context.
 - **Custom Instructions**: Steer the AI with `[USER INSTRUCTIONS]` for specific personas or tasks.
 - **Context-Aware**: Optional injection of current time/date and app language.
 - **Transparency**: View the actual [System Prompt](assets/system_prompt.txt) used.

### Caveats (Alpha Status)
PAIOS acts as a client for the underlying Gemini Nano model, which is a developer preview.
- **Device Support**: Requires a supported device with Google AI Core (e.g., Pixel 9/10 series).
- **Model Behavior**: The model is optimized for on-device use (summarization, smart reply). While powerful for its size, do not expect the same reasoning or knowledge depth as cloud-based "big" LLMs (like Gemini Pro/Ultra or GPT-4). It may hallucinate or lose context.
- **Censorship**: Typing curses or slurs may soft-lock the app if auto-retry is enabled due to internal model filters.
